  I am a Ph.D. student at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), advised by *Prof. [Liangjun Ke](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/keljxjtu)*.

  My research interests lie in **Reinforcement Learning** and the **Reward Design** problem.

  I think that ***tell agents what we want them to do*** is more important than teaching it how to do it. This issue is not limited to artificial intelligence; it is widespread in human education, business, and politics. It forms the basis of cooperation in human society, and I believe it will also be the foundation for building collaboration between humans and AI.
