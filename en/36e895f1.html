<p>Now it is 00:57 on May 17, 2023. I still can't fall asleep, maybe
because of the latte I had in the afternoon or because of what has
happened in the past few days. My mind is filled with thoughts and
debates. Instead of lying in bed and overthinking or relying on alcohol
to fall asleep, I decided to write an article at my desk to organize my
thoughts and turn the chaotic ideas into logical and organized text.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-center">
<p>Red beans grow in the southern land, how many branches bloom in
spring?</p>
<p>May you pick many, for this is the most lovesick thing.</p>

</blockquote>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>The title of this article was decided without much thought - Turning
Point. My life has undergone significant changes this year, with the
passing of my father, the breakup with my loved one, and the transition
to a doctoral student. These series of events have caused my emotions to
fluctuate greatly within a few months. I can say that my emotions after
the age of 20 are more intense than all the emotions I had before.</p>
<p>One thing that has always confused me is who I am and what I want to
do.</p>
<p>I can barely remember what happened in kindergarten. I only remember
that I was one of the top students in the class and always stood at the
back of the line. When it was time to enroll in the senior kindergarten,
there were no available spots in the kindergartens in town. My
grandfather didn't want me to stay at home, so he arranged for me to go
to the elementary school behind the village to join the first grade.
That's how I skipped senior kindergarten and preschool and went straight
to elementary school.</p>
<p>Elementary school was a simple and pure time for me. From first to
fifth grade, I was always the top student in my grade. However, since I
was raised by my grandparents, I didn't pay much attention to personal
hygiene, and I was often criticized and educated by my teachers for
this. I had a few good friends in my class, mostly smart boys. I didn't
have any close relationships with girls because they would always pull
down my pants from behind on the way home from school. Even now, I still
can't figure out why they did that. In sixth grade, my father arranged
for me to transfer to Xi'an. Before that, I was mostly raised by my
grandparents, and I would only go to Xi'an to stay with my parents for a
period of time during summer vacation. During winter vacation, my
parents would come back for the Lunar New Year. Every time I said
goodbye to my parents, I would watch them leave and then cry alone in my
room. That was probably the strongest emotion I had at that time.</p>
<p>After transferring to the elementary school in Xi'an, my grades
remained good, except for Chinese and English, which were slightly
worse. But that didn't stop me from becoming the center of attention in
the class. Being young and good at math compared to other students in my
grade, I would always be the first to finish the tasks assigned by the
teacher during math class and then go to the computer room to play (a
small benefit of having the math teacher also be the computer teacher).
Later on, the math teacher stopped letting me go to the computer room
and instead asked me to tutor my classmates in the classroom or gave me
more difficult exercises to do.</p>
<p>In junior high school, I transferred to Far East No. 2 Middle School.
The only subject I took the entrance exam for was math, and when the
results came out, my parents saw that I got the highest score and paid a
few thousand yuan less for the tuition. That was the first time I
realized the practical value of having good grades. When I first arrived
at Far East No. 2, I felt like I didn't fit in. Most of the students at
Far East No. 2 were from Far East No. 2 Elementary School, and they had
many common topics to talk about and were familiar with the surroundings
of the school. On the other hand, I came from the countryside to the
city and had no concept of many things. Moreover, I was introverted and
lacked strong social skills. However, my good grades helped me in two
ways. First, I could easily integrate into some circles by discussing
academics. Second, I didn't need to be too proactive in social
interactions. Of course, these are conclusions I have drawn looking back
now. At that time, I probably wasn't aware of these things.</p>
<p>In the second year of junior high school, I had a relationship, which
ended with me gradually ignoring the other person. There was no formal
breakup process, which I now realize was not good. The reason for the
breakup was because several of my friends told me multiple times, "She's
only with you because she wants you to help her with her homework."
After realizing the absurdity of this, I told myself that when it comes
to matters of the heart, it's enough to know how I feel, and other
people's opinions are not important.</p>
<p>By the third year of junior high school, especially before the high
school entrance exam, I began to feel lost about my own worth for the
first time. In the past, almost all of my positive feedback came from my
academic performance, while in terms of interpersonal relationships, I
usually received more negative evaluations. At that time, I gradually
didn't know how to interact with my classmates, and I would be very
sensitive when interacting with most of them, except for a few good
friends. At that time, I didn't know how to confide in others or seek
help, so I kept these thoughts to myself, waiting for a new change when
I entered high school. In the end, under the pressure of emotions and
not paying enough attention to the high school entrance exam, my exam
results were disappointing.</p>
<p>602 points, which basically meant I had no chance of getting into the
top five prestigious schools. For the first time, I saw disappointment
and seriousness on my father's face. That day, he took me to consult at
Xi'an No. 3 Middle School, and he said a lot while I remained
silent.</p>
<p>After that, I went to No. 3 Middle School, but my school records were
kept at Zunde Middle School. The only difference was that I had to pay a
few thousand more in tuition fees each year. I came to this high school
with a sense of dissatisfaction, and later I found that many others felt
the same way. Some went to Xi'an Jiaotong University Affiliated Middle
School, and some went to Tieyi Middle School. Compared to students who
graduated from the junior high school of the same school, we had more in
common. It wasn't just because of our similar backgrounds, but more
likely because we had a reverence for certain things that other students
didn't have.</p>
<p>During these three years of high school, I experienced the fastest
mental growth and also did the dumbest things. I won't go into the
specifics here because I will probably never forget them in my life. The
most impactful relationship in my life also started during this time. It
started with frequent conversations, then my confession, followed by
frequent phone calls, and then we agreed to be together. The date was
March 12, 2017, my birthday during the year of the college entrance
exam. I heard the confession while lying in bed with a high fever, and I
was really happy. The period of time after that was the happiest time
for me. Just like any couple in love, we had endless sweet words, didn't
want to hang up the phone, and had infinite expectations for our future
together. However, as the college entrance exam approached, this passion
gradually cooled down, and both of us focused most of our energy on
studying.</p>
<p>These are the most memorable moments for me before college. I won't
talk about my university life for now. Overall, it hasn't been smooth
sailing. I'll stop here with the memories and talk about the future.</p>
<p>The first thing is about sensibility and rationality. In my mind,
there are mainly two types of consciousness. One contains all kinds of
emotions: love, family, desire, laziness, cowardice, etc. The other
contains most of my rationality: logic, reasoning, knowledge,
fearlessness, prudence, etc. These two consciousnesses often argue when
faced with issues related to myself, resulting in indecisiveness and
easy changes of mind. Relatively speaking, the emotional part is weaker
and less frequent, but once it acts impulsively, it can cause
significant damage. The rational part is stronger and can support me in
accomplishing many things, but it lacks empathy. Striking a balance
between the two is an important task for the future.</p>
<p>The second thing is about the inner self. Every man has a little boy
in his heart, and even now, sometimes I still think about things as a
child. This is understandable as long as it doesn't have a negative
impact on others, especially those close to me. This is important.</p>
<p>The third thing is about my life path. After sharing so many
experiences from the past, it is to understand who I really am and what
I want to do. In the past, I was usually defined by the environment and
people around me. "A sensible child," "not talkative," "young," "poor
understanding," "good grades without parents worrying," and so on.
Sometimes I would get trapped in these definitions and live up to the
descriptions of others, chasing after their definition of "good."
However, these evaluations, although somewhat valuable, are ultimately
derived from my own perspective. I, myself, am the most fundamental
thing, not any other evaluation. Therefore, I now believe that what I
think in my heart constitutes who I am. As for what I want to do, in my
professional field, I will become a person who is valuable and
contributes to society and the people. In my personal life, health is
the top priority, and on this basis, I can pursue anything I like. In
terms of family, communication, trust, and tolerance are the three most
important things.</p>
<p>My growth in the past was passive and helpless. This turning point is
active and no longer evasive.</p>
