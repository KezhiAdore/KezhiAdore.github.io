<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Sometimes, life brings us surprises. It could be a beautiful sunset
we stumble upon while skipping class, or a blooming flower we wake up
to. In this ever-progressing industrial era, we are all involuntarily
caught up in the hustle and bustle. This is the deepest realization I've
had since I entered graduate school and gained a deeper understanding of
the world.</p>
<p><img src="https://download.kezhi.tech/img/202205102220466.jpg?x-oss-process=style/webp" width=30%></p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>In this regard, my partner, Dou Dou, has brought me a lot of
inspiration. There are two main points I have summarized: ① This world
is truly vast, to the point where each of us is so insignificant in the
face of society and the nation, feeling powerless. As the economy and
technology continue to develop, the distance between the government,
society, and individuals will become closer, and correspondingly,
individuals will feel more powerless. ② Every inch of this world is
precious, and we can always gain something by stopping to appreciate it.
The beauty of a flower lies not in itself, but in the eyes that
appreciate it; the greatness of a work lies not in the definition of the
author, but in the reader's understanding; the significance of a photo
album lies not in the precise pixels, but in the memories it contains.
Life is not lacking in beauty, but rather the discovery and appreciation
of beauty.</p>
<h2 id="anecdotes-after-the-spring-date">Anecdotes after the Spring
Date</h2>
<h3 id="section">1</h3>
<p>The Spring Date is a grand event during the spring and summer social
season in the harbor. Every time, single men and women from various
universities in Shaanxi Province gather here, hoping to meet the right
person in their lives. To ensure the seriousness of the event,
participants usually need to register in advance and sign a single
guarantee agreement, and they can enter with their admission tickets on
the day of the event.</p>
<p>On May 8, 2022, Bai Qi and Zi Yao informed me that this grand event
was taking place at Milan Building. Out of curiosity, I made an
appointment with Bai Qi to go together. Unfortunately, Zi Yao stayed at
home that day and couldn't join us. Also, due to the pandemic, students
from other universities were unable to come, which was a great pity.</p>
<p><img
src="https://download.kezhi.tech/img/202205102228785.jpg?x-oss-process=style/webp" /></p>
<p>When we arrived, it was almost time for dinner in the afternoon, and
it was drizzling. We walked towards Milan Building and saw many
disappointed faces on the men and women walking back from there. I
couldn't help but sigh: the weather was just like the mood of these men
and women. It was clear when they arrived, but became gloomy when they
left.</p>
<p>Entering the venue (although we didn't have admission tickets, who
would care about admission tickets when the event was about to end), the
scene inside could be summarized as follows: most men and women were
staying with people of the same sex, and only a few were interacting
with the opposite sex. On the way back, I suggested that we bring
friends to participate in this event next year. Bai Qi told me that it
would be better to come alone, as with more people, we might only play
with our companions who came with us. She was right, not only here, but
also among the young people I could interact with. Interactions between
men and women have become a difficult thing, something burdensome that
must be done for the purpose of marriage, rather than for the joy that
comes from interacting and playing with the opposite sex.</p>
<p>If the desire for the opposite sex brought about by reproduction is
the most natural and primitive pursuit of human beings, then the
discomfort we feel when interacting with the opposite sex nowadays is,
in a sense, a regression. Of course, I don't want to go back to that
primitive era. I just hope that at some point in the future, people can
freely interact with others, regardless of whether they are of the same
sex or opposite sex, for the sake of spiritual pleasure.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">2</h3>
<p>Last month, I bought a pot of gardenia flowers. When they were
delivered, they were still in bud. This was my first time raising
flowers, and I was full of hope for them to bloom. Finally, one morning,
I woke up to a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p><img
src="https://download.kezhi.tech/img/202205102250858.jpg?x-oss-process=style/webp" /></p>
<p>Its blooming was sudden and splendid. At that moment, I felt the
vitality of life. The beauty of a flower lies not only in its
brightness, but also in the moment it blooms. In the future, I can try
using time-lapse photography to capture the moment of blooming.</p>
<p>Good things don't last long. Due to the small size of the pot for the
gardenia flowers, the nutrients inside were not enough. The flowers
gradually withered, and although there were new flowers blooming later,
only the newest one bloomed beautifully.</p>
<p><img
src="https://download.kezhi.tech/img/202205102253440.jpg?x-oss-process=style/webp" /></p>
<p>The blooming of flowers brings joy, while their withering makes us
sigh at the cruelty of time. However, if I change to a larger pot and
fertilize it in a timely manner, can I make all the flowers bloom with
nourishment? It's worth a try.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">3</h3>
<p>Sometimes, surprises may not necessarily be a good thing. On May 9,
2022, while I was busy studying the "Beginner's Guide to Mining," I
suddenly learned that the homework for the optimal control course was
due the next day, and it involved four assignments. However, I have a
habit that when I am immersed in one thing, I prioritize finishing what
I am currently working on before dealing with other urgent matters.</p>
<p>As a result, my mining study didn't end until half past eleven in the
evening. Finally, the computer could mine on its own. Looking at the
running hash on the screen and the blank A4 paper I had prepared for the
assignment, I couldn't help but feel that I was torturing myself.</p>
<p>In order to learn faster and complete the assignments, I went
upstairs to find Lao Wang to work on them together. On the way, I
remembered that Han Chi's workstation should be nearby, so I went to
take a look.</p>
<p><img
src="https://download.kezhi.tech/img/202205102302265.jpg?x-oss-process=style/webp" /></p>
<p>Jerry is really cute!</p>
<h3 id="section-3">4</h3>
<p>I don't know if it's because I spend too much time looking at
screens, lack of sleep, or frequently rubbing my eyes, but recently I
often feel dryness and itching in my eyes. I decided to go to the nearby
pharmacy in Xinghua to buy eye drops, but I kept forgetting to do so for
a few days. Finally, on the afternoon of May 10, 2022, I remembered this
matter, went to Han Ying Building for lunch, and bought the eye drops.
However, these eye drops are quite unique in appearance.</p>
<p><img
src="https://download.kezhi.tech/img/202205102305766.jpg?x-oss-process=style/webp" /></p>
<p>To be honest, this is the first time I've seen eye drops in this
form. I used to use the small bottle ones. But upon careful
consideration, this kind of eye drops has its advantages. Firstly, it is
a single-use package, greatly reducing the risk of contamination.
Secondly, the individual packaging serves as a reminder for me to use
the eye drops in a timely manner, rather than remembering it later like
before. Overall, ergonomics is an essential aspect of product design,
and having this kind of design is better.</p>
<h2 id="some-minor-matters-after-film-and-television-creation">Some
Minor Matters after Film and Television Creation</h2>
<h3 id="section-4">1</h3>
<p>"Film and Television Creation" is an elective course for graduate
students at the Innovation Harbor. I was very fortunate to have enrolled
in this course when it was first offered. The reason I initially chose
this course was because the instructor was good-looking, and her
educational background made me very curious (see <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://rwxy.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1091/4265.htm">Wang Yao - School of
Humanities and Social Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University
(xjtu.edu.cn)</a>).</p>
<p>The format of this course is as follows: 6-8 people form a group and
complete the entire process of creating a microfilm. For the creative
process of this film, please refer to <a
href="https://kezhi.tech/Explanation-of-the-Creation-of-the-Film-ByteDance/">Explanation
of the Creation of the Film "ByteDance"</a>. I was very fortunate to be
the leader of the group.</p>
<p><img
src="https://download.kezhi.tech/img/202206011656848.jpg?x-oss-process=style/webp" /></p>
<p>For a long time, I have dealt with many things on my own and rarely
collaborated with others. Also, due to the fact that group assignments
during my student days were often about getting a good grade rather than
completing the project seriously, I didn't have much experience in
leading and cooperating with others. This film and television creation
project was different. There was no excessive pursuit of grades in this
elective course, and the project itself also matched the interests of
some members of our group. Therefore, I believed that we should put some
seriousness into the filming of this microfilm.</p>
<p>Ren Zhengfei once said: "Being ahead is simple, just do better than
others; being a leader is difficult, it requires leading everyone
together." Being ahead and being a leader are two completely different
things. Being ahead only requires doing one's own things well, while
being a leader is different. Being a leader requires ensuring that
everyone does their own things well. This involves matching abilities
and tasks, and stimulating enthusiasm, etc., which are all related to
people.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is important to mobilize the subjective initiative of the
group members. I believe the best way is to make everyone a contributor
to the creation, so that everyone takes the subsequent processes
seriously. In other words, this is similar to a rule I once read about
relationships: "A person's feelings depend more on how much they give,
and less on how much they receive." For this reason, during the
scriptwriting process, all members of our group participated and made
contributions, and they identified with the script. This way, we
wouldn't just go through the motions in the subsequent processes.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of division of labor. Fortunately, the
members of our group are versatile, including photography enthusiasts,
pet owners, video editing experts, film enthusiasts, and avid learners.
Each person's individual abilities are not sufficient to produce a film
with rich content, but when these abilities are combined, they can
overcome the difficulties encountered in the creative process. In
addition, reasonable task allocation is necessary, taking into account
each person's schedule and individual abilities. However, the tasks in
film and television creation are heterogeneous, such as writing the
script, storyboarding, planning the shooting schedule, shooting, and
post-production. The workload of these tasks will inevitably differ,
which will lead to unequal task durations and fairness issues. Faced
with this problem, I believe it is important to respect individual
preferences. For the participants who are truly passionate about this
film, even if it means staying up late to edit, they are willing to see
their own results. As for the participants who are not willing to invest
a lot of personal time, there is no need to overly criticize them. What
needs to be paid attention to is not letting the latter affect the
enthusiasm and dedication of the former, which requires constant
attention.</p>
<p>Finally, the feeling of several people working together towards a
common goal is great. Some people skipped group meetings for the sake of
shooting, some actively prepared props and made good use of existing
conditions to solve difficulties, some traveled a long way to assist us
in shooting, some spent a day in advance scouting locations to ensure
everything went smoothly on the day of shooting, and some took the time
to edit the post-production meticulously. The whole process was arduous,
but the result was beautiful. This experience of working together taught
me a vivid lesson. Collaboration is a wonderful thing.</p>

<h3 id="section-5">2</h3>
<p>On June 1, 2022, I woke up early in the morning and heard the phone
ringing. It was from Taikang Life Insurance. They have been calling me
many times recently, but coincidentally, they always called when I was
busy, so I never answered. Today happened to be a time when I had some
free time, so I answered the call and had a chat.</p>
<p>The phone call was mainly about promoting their accidental insurance.
I won't go into the details of the insurance itself, but this sales call
reminded me of an experience I had about half a year ago when China
Merchants Bank was promoting insurance to me. There was a significant
difference between the salespeople in these two sales calls. The former
didn't waste much time and, after obtaining my consent, explained the
details of the insurance to me in detail and reminded me to record the
key information of the insurance policy for future consideration. After
the introduction, they sent me a document detailing the insurance plan
for reference. In this communication, they didn't ask me to immediately
apply for the insurance, but gave me enough time to consider whether I
needed to purchase it. They called me back after a day and had a
detailed discussion about the follow-up matters. In today's sales call,
compared to the former, it seemed less professional. Firstly, the
salesperson's speech was not clear enough, and his voice was not loud
enough. I had to listen very carefully to hear what he was saying. After
a brief introduction of the insurance, he also asked me to take notes,
but instead of recording important information about the insurance, he
asked me to write down his employee number. After this conversation, he
immediately started confirming my personal information, including my
name, age, etc. However, it was obvious that Taikang was promoting to me
based on the registered information of my phone number, and the
information they mentioned was all about my mother. This contradicted
what they initially said about selecting high-quality customers for
promotion. After confirming the basic information, they asked for my ID
card number, bank card number, and other information to process the
transaction.</p>
<p>I won't go into the details of what happened afterwards, but these
two different sales experiences reflect the training of salespeople, the
attitude of the company towards salespeople, and the importance of
service in the insurance business. Personally, I would prefer to
purchase insurance from the former salesperson. The entire process
demonstrated respect for my personal preferences and respect for the
contract. It doesn't necessarily mean that I will get a better contract
in this situation, but as an individual, this kind of communication
makes me more confident that when I encounter an accident, the personnel
trained by such a company will be able to efficiently solve the problem
for me. As for the latter, even if their insurance coverage is good,
their approach in promoting it made me doubt whether the company that
recruits and trains such salespeople would be able to respond promptly
when I encounter an accident.</p>
<p>The above paragraph is biased. A good impression of a salesperson
does not necessarily mean that the company's business capabilities are
good, and a poor impression of a salesperson does not mean that their
service will be bad. However, this is my personal feeling, which is an
important factor in cooperation in our society. This feeling is
reflected in many aspects. Teachers look for a feeling when recruiting
students, employers look for a feeling when hiring employees, and
individuals consider the feeling towards a brand when choosing products.
When I was young, I always thought that this feeling was not important.
I believed that good things would naturally be appreciated. However, as
I grew older, I increasingly realized that sometimes this feeling could
be the determining factor in the outcome of things. Therefore, feelings
should not be taken lightly. If I were to start a company in the future,
I would need to pay attention to this.</p>
