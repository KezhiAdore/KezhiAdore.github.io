<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>"ByteDance" was created from late May to early June 2022, taking half
a month. It is the highest level short film I have participated in so
far.</p>

<h2 id="film-overview">Film Overview</h2>
<p>"ByteDance" won the Best Film Award in the 2022 Master's Degree
General Elective Course "Film Creation" at Xi'an Jiaotong University.
The actor who played Lin Ning also won the Best Actor Award. The full
film can be viewed below:</p>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>The film creation process mainly includes the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the story theme and outline</li>
<li>Write the script</li>
<li>Write storyboards based on the script</li>
<li>Confirm shooting locations</li>
<li>Develop a shooting plan and prepare equipment and props</li>
<li>Film shooting</li>
<li>Post-production</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections will explain each of the above processes in
detail.</p>
<p>In terms of team collaboration, the following solutions were mainly
used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tencent Meeting: Online meetings and communication without
geographical limitations</li>
<li>Shimo Online Documents: Collaborative editing and viewing of
documents online, allowing real-time updates and facilitating text
collaboration</li>
<li>Seafile Cloud Storage: A cloud storage that can be mounted to the
computer directory, used by our team to store all shooting materials for
easy access and collaboration with special effects files.</li>

<h3 id="determine-the-story-theme-and-outline">Determine the Story Theme
and Outline</h3>
<p>This step is the most brainstorming and creative part of the entire
creation process. Our team consists of students majoring in science and
engineering, so this step was relatively challenging. During the
discussion phase in class, our team considered many themes, including
suspense, love, science fiction, and even contemplation of the meaning
of life. Science fiction was slightly more difficult in terms of
shooting and post-production, so it was the first to be ruled out. As
for the meaning of life, it was abandoned because the team members could
not reach a consensus. Finally, we discussed the themes of suspense and
love, and during the discussion, we suddenly thought that we are
students with a background in artificial intelligence, so we focused on
a story about artificial intelligence falling in love with a human.</p>
<p>The story is not complicated. It tells the story of the relationship
between an artificial intelligence male lead and a human female lead.
The characteristics of the male lead are already obvious, he is an
artificial intelligence. At this point, we need to give the female lead
certain characteristics. The most common characteristic of artificial
intelligence is the lack of explicit emotions, so we gave the female
lead the ability to read minds to highlight the male lead's uniqueness
in her world. In addition, we also need to consider the motivation for
the two characters to develop feelings for each other. The initial
considerations are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The female lead discovers that people often say one thing but mean
another, but she cannot read the male lead's mind, which piques her
curiosity. After becoming friends, she gradually develops feelings for
him through their time together.</li>
<li>The male lead is the result of a strong artificial intelligence
program and theoretically lacks explicit emotions. The experiences of
interacting with the female lead form the basis for his emotional
development, leading to the development of feelings.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, the core of the story for this film creation is
complete.</p>
<h3 id="write-the-script">Write the Script</h3>
<p>Writing the script is the process of enriching and completing the
outline into a complete story. In other words, it is the step-by-step
finalization of the details. Our team used the Tencent Meeting and Shimo
Online Documents for this process. We held two meetings to discuss the
script. The first meeting completed the draft of the script, and the
second meeting confirmed some details of the script (such as how the
male and female leads become acquainted, the plot twists, and the
ending). In addition, the script went through multiple revisions during
the process of writing storyboards, preparing for shooting, and actual
shooting. Here are some interesting processes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Determining the names of the male and female leads. Lin Ning and Mo
Chi are homophonic with "Machine Learning". In addition, because
artificial intelligence and robots require graduate students to clock in
early, Mo Chi also implies that graduate students should not be
late.</li>
<li>The line of the heart voice at the end of the film went through many
revisions, including "Lin Ning, I like you," "Lin Ning, I think I
understand what it means to like someone," and so on. Finally, it was
finalized as "Lin Ning, I know what it means to like someone." On the
one hand, Lin Ning reads Mo Chi's mind and shows that Mo Chi has
developed feelings. On the other hand, it leaves room for
interpretation, as it does not directly explain Mo Chi's feelings for
Lin Ning, leaving it to the audience's imagination.</li>
<li>About the film title. The name "ByteDance" naturally emerged with
the story plot. "Byte" represents artificial intelligence, and "Dance"
represents the development of emotions. The name "ByteDance" is very
fitting. Perhaps the founder of ByteDance, an AI company, also had this
idea?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="write-storyboards-based-on-the-script">Write Storyboards Based
on the Script</h3>
<p>Writing storyboards may seem like a simple task, just turning the
script into a series of scenes. However, if there are problems with the
storyboards, it can cause significant inconvenience during shooting.
Since our team had no previous experience in shooting films, we focused
on considering the guidance for subsequent shooting when writing the
storyboards. For most shots, we used on-site rehearsals and test shots
with mobile phones to confirm how the shots would be composed and where
the camera would be positioned.</p>
<h3 id="confirm-shooting-locations">Confirm Shooting Locations</h3>
<p>When writing the storyboards, we had some ideas for shooting
locations, such as in a park, in a classroom, in a corridor, and so on.
However, if we followed these storyboards to guide the shooting, it
would inevitably take a lot of time to find suitable locations, greatly
reducing shooting efficiency. Therefore, after determining the shooting
time, Jing Xue, Zi Qian, and I started looking for suitable locations
and times in advance. The main shooting locations for our film include
classrooms, school roads, parks, rooftops, dormitory entrances, and
dormitories. The location selection process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the classroom, we considered the staircase classrooms in the
west annex building of Hanying Building. We chose this location for two
reasons: first, the staircase classrooms here have a youthful campus
feel and good indoor lighting; second, in the evening, the outdoor light
shines through the windows, creating a good shooting effect (although
the outdoor lighting was not good on the actual shooting day).</li>
<li>For the school roads, we initially considered the wide roads south
of Hanying Building, the corridor at the entrance of Hongli Building,
and the corridor outside Building 3. We finally chose the corridor north
of Building 3 because there were fewer shared bicycles nearby (there
were many shared bicycles near Hongli Building), and there were many
plants nearby that created light spots, which looked better. On the
actual shooting day, we chose the corridor on the east side of Building
3 because the lighting there was darker, and this road was connected to
the wide road south of Hanying Building, which provided a good
transition for the plot.</li>
<li>Choosing a location for the park was a big problem. There really is
nothing near the Innovation Harbor!!! And the green spaces inside the
Innovation Harbor itself are not particularly scenic. We finally decided
to shoot near the so-called "Yanzhi Slope" near the Innovation
Harbor.</li>
<li>The rooftop location was determined while looking for locations.
Initially, we wanted to find a place with a beautiful view, and then we
discovered that the sunset was beautiful that evening, so we decided to
try shooting on the rooftop. The result was indeed good. And luckily,
the sunset was even more beautiful on the actual shooting day.</li>
<li>For the dormitory entrance, it took a long time to confirm the
location because this scene involved the cat's exit, and it couldn't be
too far from the cat's living area. Also, there couldn't be too many
objects. We finally chose the road south of the cafeteria in the B South
Area as the shooting location.</li>
<li>For the dormitory interior, it was relatively simple. Jing Xue's
dormitory was beautifully decorated, and it looked great in the shots.
Nice!</li>
<li>In addition, there are scenes of the male and female leads going on
outings together in the main plot. In order to give these scenes a
realistic and romantic atmosphere, we chose scenes in a shopping mall,
the green space of the Innovation Harbor, and the Milan Building for
shooting. When designing these scenes, we found that there were too many
shots of them walking together:joy: - they walk and talk, walk together
in the mall, walk next to Einstein, and even walk together to visit the
Milan Building. It seems that besides walking, they only walk:happy:
(although people with dating experience say that walking together is
indeed common). To make these scenes less monotonous, we designed each
scene with some creativity. We changed the mall scene to them playing
claw machines together (but there were no claw machines in DaKe Mall, so
we changed it to eating), added a scene where the female lead imitates
Einstein next to his statue, and added a scene of an office chair race
in the Milan Building because there was a swivel chair there. This made
these shots look more diverse.</li>

<h3 id="develop-a-shooting-plan-and-prepare-equipment-and-props">Develop
a Shooting Plan and Prepare Equipment and Props</h3>
<p>The equipment and props used in this shoot are as follows:</p>
<p>Video recording equipment: Canon 600D×1, Canon 70D×1, Canon 6D Mark
II×1</p>
<p>Audio recording equipment: PINSUN wireless lapel microphone
[one-to-one] [type-c interface]×2, mobile phones×2 (used as receivers
for the microphones)</p>
<p>Stabilization equipment: Tripods×2, camera stabilizer</p>
<p>Clapperboard: Physical clapperboard×1, iPad clapperboard×2
(Clapperboard software: "Easy Clapper")</p>
<p>Animals: Puppet (cat)×1</p>
<p>Props: Pigeon feed×1, painting×1, cat cup×1, clothing, "Machine
Learning" book×1, "Deep Learning" book×1, notebook (Notebook)×1,
laptop×1</p>
<p>The preparation of shooting props was done in stages. After
determining the shooting, the preparation of camera equipment, audio
equipment, stabilization equipment, and clapperboards were put on the
schedule. The key props in the plot were determined during the
discussion of the script and storyboards, such as pigeon feed, cat, and
painting. The remaining props were determined during the specific set
design and shooting, such as clothing, notebooks, and books.</p>
<p>The shooting plan is crucial for the efficient shooting of the film.
The male and female leads do not reside in the Innovation Harbor, so the
shooting time was very tight, and we needed to complete all the shooting
within a day and a half. Therefore, the shooting plan and preparation
before shooting were made to save as much shooting time as possible.
When developing the shooting plan, the following principles were
considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize scenes with time constraints (such as the rooftop scene
at sunset)</li>
<li>Shoot all scenes in the same location at once to save time for
moving locations</li>
<li>Group scenes that are connected in the plot together to ensure
actors' understanding of the plot</li>
<li>Shoot from multiple angles and positions, record audio with multiple
devices to ensure redundant footage</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="film-shooting">Film Shooting</h3>
<p>Shooting is the process of turning the creative and planned ideas
into reality. The shooting process of a film requires a strict and
standardized workflow to ensure the usability and standardization of the
footage. Since the shooting was scheduled for Friday and Saturday, the
shooting part of the film creation course coincided with the shooting
process. We followed the following process during the shooting:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Arrive at the shooting location. Each member of the production team
has a copy of the shooting plan, and the actors have the script.</li>
<li>The director informs the production team and actors of the scenes to
be shot based on the shooting plan and explains the emotions to ensure
that the actors understand the emotions.</li>
<li>The cinematographer determines the camera positions and shooting
paths based on the director's requirements.</li>
<li>The sound recordist determines the microphone placement based on the
actors' actions and camera angles.</li>
<li>All departments are ready, and the clapperboard is placed in front
of the camera by the script supervisor.</li>
<li>The director shouts "Three, two, one, action." When shouting
"Three," the sound recordist and cinematographer start recording. When
shouting "One," the script supervisor moves away from the camera.</li>
<li>The director shouts "Cut," and the sound recordist and
cinematographer stop recording.</li>
<li>The sound recordist renames the audio files in the format "n_k_r
take" <span class="math inline">\(n,k,r \in N^+\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>After the shooting on Friday, the shooting process was discussed in
class, and we realized that we needed to make some adjustments to our
shooting process. Based on our own shooting process, we summarized the
following issues and solutions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The problem of missing shots: The script and editing of the male
lead's storyline were not very detailed, which led to some abrupt
transitions in the editing of the male lead's shots after shooting.
Since the male and female leads do not reside in the Innovation Harbor,
it would be costly to reshoot the missing shots. To solve this problem,
we decided to use some first-person perspective and close-up shots to
fill in the missing footage (since the face is not visible anyway). As a
result, we added first-person perspective running shots in the later
part of the film<del>(I running around with the camera in the Innovation
Harbor really looked like an idiot)</del>. In addition, during the
shooting process, there was a scene where the female lead gave a
painting to the male lead, but the content of the painting was shot
after the scene. To ensure smooth shooting and avoid additional costs,
we used a blank piece of paper as a prop during the shooting and later
had the actor's hand replace it in the close-up shots.</p></li>
<li><p>The problem of continuity errors in the film: During the elevator
scene, there was a mirror reflection inside the elevator, which
inevitably captured the cinematographer in the shot, as shown in the
left image below. Moreover, the camera was constantly moving at this
time, making it impossible to simply cover up the reflection. After
exploring many solutions, we used the method shown in <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1KE411X7gY?share_source=copy_web">【Premiere】pr移除场景中的杂物_哔哩哔哩_bilibili</a>
to remove the person captured in the shot, as shown in the right image
below.</p></li>

<h3 id="post-production">Post-Production</h3>
<p>The post-production of this film was relatively extensive, involving
film editing, handling of voiceovers (heart voice), special effects
production, and memory flashback effects. Therefore, the workload was
divided among three team members. The responsibilities were as follows:
Yi Xin was responsible for the opening, editing, audio effects, and
transitions in the first half of the film; Jing Xue was responsible for
the editing, audio effects, memory flashback effects, and special scenes
in the second half of the film; I was responsible for special effects,
subtitles, and the ending. This division of work minimized the coupling
between tasks and ensured that each part could be worked on
independently, greatly improving production efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition, at the beginning of the editing process, the three
post-production team members created a WeChat group for easy
communication. After the initial editing, an unexpected guest joined the
group - me. She did not participate in any editing work but joined the
group to push the members of the editing team to finish their work as
soon as possible. However, her role turned out to be more than that. On
top of constantly urging the post-production team, she provided feedback
and improvement suggestions for each edited segment. This turned out to
be necessary because the editor may repeatedly watch and make changes to
a segment, which may lead to overlooking the overall impression of the
film, i.e., the audience's first impression when watching the film. The
arrival of this "unexpected guest" ensured that each segment had an
audience member providing suggestions, which greatly contributed to the
overall quality of the final film.</p>
<h2 id="equipment-and-device-usage">Equipment and Device Usage</h2>
<p>The equipment used in this shoot is as follows:</p>
<p>Video recording equipment: Canon 600D×1, Canon 70D×1, Canon 6D Mark
II×1</p>
<p>Audio recording equipment: PINSUN wireless lapel microphone
[one-to-one] [type-c interface]×2, mobile phones×2 (used as receivers
for the microphones)</p>
<p>Stabilization equipment: Tripods×2, camera stabilizer</p>
<p>For detailed explanations of the equipment and their usage, please
refer to the "Develop a Shooting Plan and Prepare Equipment and Props"
and "Film Shooting" sections above.</p>
<p>Some additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The camera stabilizer was rented, but it was not easy to use. It
took a long time to balance it. We eventually gave up and switched to
handheld shooting. The result was that the slightly shaky footage
actually had better expressive power than completely static shots. On
the other hand, the cinematographer's ability to shoot handheld also
improved significantly.</li>
<li>The tripods played a significant role during the shooting, providing
stable support for shots that required stability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problems-solutions-and-lessons-learned">Problems, Solutions, and
Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>This film creation process allowed our team to experience the entire
process from an idea to a film, and we encountered many difficulties and
challenges along the way. Finding solutions to these difficulties was a
process of growth for us. Here, we record the problems, solutions, and
lessons learned during the creation process.</p>
<h3 id="problem-of-missing-shots">1. Problem of missing shots</h3>
