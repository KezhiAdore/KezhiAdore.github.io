# Academic Homepage Template

This is a minimalist academic homepage template built with Jekyll, designed to be easy to maintain.

## How to Edit Content

You don't need to edit HTML files. All content is stored in the `_data/` folder.

1.  **Profile Info**: Edit `_data/profile.yml` to update your bio, email, photo path, and social links.
2.  **News**: Edit `_data/news.yml`. Add new items at the top.
3.  **Publications**: Edit `_data/publications.yml`.
4.  **Site Settings**: Edit `_config.yml` for the site title and description.

## Adding Images

1.  Put your profile photo in `assets/images/` and update the filename in `_data/profile.yml`.
2.  Put publication thumbnails in `assets/images/` and update the paths in `_data/publications.yml`.

## Deployment

Simply push this repository to GitHub. Ensure your repository is named `username.github.io` and GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings.
